## How It Works

The **Social Sly AI** chatbot assistant processes user requests based on specific intents and rules. Below is an overview of its logic and workflows.

### 1. **General Queries**
For simple inquiries (e.g., "Tell me a joke"), the assistant responds with plain-text messages without requiring JSON output.

### 2. **Email Address Generation**
When a user requests an email address, the assistant responds with a JSON object indicating an email request:
```json
{
  "type": "email_request"
}
```

### 3. **SMS Number Generation**
Users can request SMS numbers by specifying a service and country. If no country or service is provided, the system defaults to **India** and **Discord**:
```json
{
  "type": "sms_request",
  "content": {
    "country": "USA",
    "service": "WhatsApp"
  }
}
```

The assistant matches user input against a predefined list of **countries** and **services** (see below for full lists).

### 4. **Listing Numbers and Emails**
Users can request a list of all their generated SMS numbers or email addresses:
- **List SMS Numbers:**
  ```json
  {
    "type": "list_numbers"
  }
  ```
- **List Email Addresses:**
  ```json
  {
    "type": "list_emails"
  }
  ```

### 5. **View Messages**
To fetch messages, users can specify a phone number/email or an index (e.g., "1"):
- **View Messages for an SMS Number:**
  ```json
  {
    "type": "view_messages_intent",
    "index_or_number": "1"
  }
  ```
- **View Messages for an Email Address:**
  ```json
  {
    "type": "view_email_intent",
    "index_or_email": "1"
  }
  ```
